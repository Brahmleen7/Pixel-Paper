    <strong>Student â€“ Personalized Learning Space</strong><br><br>
    The Student Login Page is the gateway to a personalized and adaptive educational journey. Once logged in, students undergo a learning-style assessment that classifies them as practical, visual, theoretical, or self-paced learners. Based on this, the dashboard dynamically recommends educational resources like videos, quizzes, PDFs, case studies, and past papers tailored to their unique needs.<br><br>

    <strong>Key features include:</strong><br>
    - Personalized content recommendations<br>
    - Self-paced and interest-based learning<br>
    - Performance analytics with progress reports<br>
    - Career guidance suggestions based on interest and strength<br>
    - Instant access to assignments and feedback from teachers<br><br>

    The interface is user-friendly, interactive, and gamified to keep learners engaged. It encourages independent learning while still providing structure and mentorship through AI-powered insights and teacher feedback.
